DistanceMap
===========
This is a prototype of how to grab how long it will take between two coordinates.

HOW TO USE:
-----------
1. Set the apikey in app/controller/home_controller
2. run vagrant with `vagrant up`
3. run `gem install bundle`
4. run `bundle install`
5. run the server as `rails s -p3000 -b0.0.0.0`
6. access on http://localhost:3100

WHAT IS MISSING
---------------
* Multiple markers Supports
* Better handling of apikey
* Restrict the marker to be inside specific area
* Type in address for marker.
